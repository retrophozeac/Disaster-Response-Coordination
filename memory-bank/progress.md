## ðŸŽ¯ Detailed 8-Phase Implementation Plan

**Phase 1-6: Backend Development (COMPLETED)**
*   [x] All backend features, including core APIs, AI integration, real-time communication, and advanced data services, are fully implemented and operational.

**Phase 7: Frontend Integration & Testing (2 hours) - COMPLETED**
*   [x] **Goal:** Build a comprehensive client to test and demonstrate all backend functionalities.
*   [x] **Tasks:**
    *   [x] **Core Setup:** Initialized a Vite + React project with all necessary dependencies (React Router, Redux, Axios, Material-UI).
    *   [x] **API & State Management:** Built a complete API layer and configured a Redux store with slices for disasters, reports, and resources.
    *   [x] **Home Page:** Created a home page that displays a list of all disasters, with a button to create new disasters and a filter to search by tags.
    *   [x] **Details Page:** Implemented a disaster details page that shows all information for a single disaster, including reports (with verification status) and resources.
    *   [x] **Content Creation:** Added forms to create new disasters, reports, and resources.
    *   [x] **Disaster Management:** Implemented functionality to update and delete disasters.
    *   [x] **Nearby Resources:** Created a dedicated page to search for nearby resources.
    *   [x] **UI/UX Enhancements:** Applied a custom Material-UI theme, improved layouts with Grid and Card components, and added icons for better usability.

**Phase 8: Deployment & Finalization (0.5 hours)**
*   [ ] **Goal:** Deploy the application and complete the assignment.
*   [ ] **Tasks:**
    *   Deploy the backend to Render.
    *   Deploy the frontend to Vercel.
    *   Perform final end-to-end testing and prepare submission documentation.

## ðŸ”§ Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Known Implementation Challenges
1. **Geospatial Performance Requirements**
   - Challenge: Sub-second response times for proximity queries
   - Solution: Strategic GIST indexing on location columns
   - Status: Architecture planned, implementation pending

2. **External API Rate Limiting**
   - Challenge: Multiple external services with rate limits
   - Solution: Supabase caching with 1-hour TTL and fallback responses
   - Status: Caching strategy defined, implementation pending

3. **Real-time Data Broadcasting**
   - Challenge: Efficient WebSocket event management
   - Solution: Room-based broadcasting per disaster with global events
   - Status: Architecture designed, Socket.IO implementation pending

### Risk Mitigation Strategies
- **Time Constraint Management**: MVP-first approach with clear phase priorities
- **API Failures**: Fallback to mock responses for all external services
- **Performance Issues**: Proactive indexing and query optimization

## ðŸ“Š Success Metrics & Evaluation Criteria

### Assignment Evaluation Breakdown
- **Functionality (50%)**: All REST APIs operational, WebSockets working, geospatial queries executing
- **Backend Complexity (30%)**: Effective Supabase caching, geospatial indexes, rate limiting
- **External Integrations (15%)**: Creative Gemini integration, geocoding, mock social media
- **AI Tool Usage (5%)**: Effective Cursor/Windsurf usage with documented impact

### Technical Performance Targets
- [ ] API response times under 500ms for cached requests
- [ ] Geospatial queries returning results within 1 second
- [ ] WebSocket message delivery latency under 100ms
- [ ] Cache hit rate above 70% for external API calls
