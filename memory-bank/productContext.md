# Product Context Documentation

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** Disaster Response Coordination Platform  
**Project Type:** Backend-heavy MERN Stack Web Application  
**Context:** Technical Assignment for Job Application  
**Timeline:** 8-10 hour intensive development sprint

## Problem Statement

This project addresses critical gaps in disaster response coordination that were specifically outlined in the assignment requirements:

### Primary Problems Identified
1. **Fragmented Information Sources** - Emergency responders currently struggle with scattered data across social media, government websites, and user reports
2. **Unstructured Location Data Processing** - Need to extract and geocode location information from natural language disaster descriptions
3. **Delayed Resource Discovery** - Lack of real-time geospatial queries to locate nearby shelters, resources, and affected areas
4. **Information Authenticity Concerns** - Difficulty distinguishing legitimate disaster reports from potentially manipulated content
5. **Communication Delays** - Absence of real-time coordination capabilities between response teams

## Target Users
