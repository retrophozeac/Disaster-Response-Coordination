# Project Brief: Disaster Response Coordination Platform

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** Disaster Response Coordination Platform  
**Project Type:** Backend-heavy MERN Stack Web Application  
**Duration:** 1 day (8-10 hours intensive sprint)  
**Context:** Job Application Technical Assignment

This project is a comprehensive disaster response coordination platform that aggregates real-time data to aid disaster management operations. The platform combines AI-powered location extraction, geospatial database queries, real-time social media monitoring, and official updates aggregation to provide a centralized hub for disaster response coordination.

### Core Functionality
- **Disaster Data Management:** Complete CRUD operations for disaster records with ownership tracking and audit trails
- **AI-Powered Location Processing:** Google Gemini API integration for extracting location names from disaster descriptions and converting them to coordinates
- **Real-Time Social Media Monitoring:** Mock Twitter API implementation for processing social media reports and alerts
- **Geospatial Resource Mapping:** Supabase PostGIS queries for location-based resource discovery and proximity searches
- **Official Updates Aggregation:** Web scraping of government and relief organization websites (FEMA, Red Cross)
- **Image Verification:** AI-powered analysis of disaster images for authenticity verification
- **Real-Time Updates:** WebSocket implementation for live data broadcasting

## Problem Statement

Disaster response coordination currently suffers from fragmented information sources and delayed data aggregation. Emergency responders, relief organizations, and affected communities need a unified platform that can:

1. **Aggregate Multiple Data Sources:** Combine social media reports, official updates, and user-submitted information in real-time
2. **Process Unstructured Location Data:** Extract and geocode location information from natural language descriptions
3. **Enable Geospatial Resource Discovery:** Quickly locate nearby shelters, resources, and affected areas using proximity-based queries
4. **Verify Information Authenticity:** Distinguish between legitimate disaster reports and potentially manipulated content
5. **Provide Real-Time Coordination:** Enable instant updates and communication between response teams

This assignment specifically tests the candidate's ability to build complex backend systems with multiple API integrations, geospatial data processing, and real-time communication capabilities.

## Technical Architecture

### Backend Stack
- **Runtime:** Node.js with Express.js
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL with PostGIS extensions)
- **Real-Time:** Socket.IO for WebSocket communication
- **Authentication:** Mock authentication with hard-coded users and roles

### External Service Integrations
- **AI Processing:** Google Gemini API for location extraction and image verification
- **Geocoding:** OpenStreetMap Nominatim (free tier to avoid API costs)
- **Social Media:** Mock Twitter API implementation
- **Web Scraping:** Cheerio.js for official updates from government websites
- **Caching:** Supabase-based caching with 1-hour TTL

### Frontend Stack
- **Framework:** React (minimal implementation for API testing)
- **Deployment:** Vercel for frontend hosting
- **Real-Time:** Socket.IO client for live updates

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Core tables with geospatial support
disasters: (id, title, location_name, location [GEOGRAPHY], description, tags[], owner_id, created_at, audit_trail [JSONB])
reports: (id, disaster_id, user_id, content, image_url, verification_status, created_at)
resources: (id, disaster_id, name, location_name, location [GEOGRAPHY], type, created_at)
cache: (key, value [JSONB], expires_at)
```

## Success Criteria

### Primary Evaluation Metrics (Assignment-Specific)
1. **Functionality (50%):** All REST APIs operational, WebSockets working, geospatial queries executing correctly
2. **Backend Complexity (30%):** Effective Supabase caching, geospatial indexes, rate limiting, and error handling
3. **External Integrations (15%):** Creative implementation of Gemini location extraction, geocoding, and mock social media
4. **AI Tool Usage (5%):** Effective use of Cursor/Windsurf with documented impact

### Technical Success Indicators
- [ ] Complete REST API implementation with all specified endpoints
- [ ] Real-time WebSocket communication for disaster updates
- [ ] Functional geospatial queries with sub-second response times
- [ ] Successful AI integration for location extraction and image verification
- [ ] Robust caching system with proper TTL management
- [ ] Mock social media API returning realistic disaster-related data
- [ ] Minimal but functional React frontend testing all backend APIs
- [ ] Successful deployment to Vercel (frontend) and Render (backend)

### Performance Targets
- API response times under 500ms for cached requests
- Geospatial queries returning results within 1 second
- WebSocket message delivery latency under 100ms
- Cache hit rate above 70% for external API calls

## Key Stakeholders

### Assignment Context
- **Hiring Manager/Technical Lead:** Primary evaluator assessing backend architecture skills
- **Development Team:** Future colleagues evaluating code quality and system design approach
- **Technical Interviewer:** Assessing problem-solving approach and AI tool integration

### Simulated End Users (for context)
- **Emergency Response Coordinators:** Need real-time situational awareness
- **Relief Organization Staff:** Require resource allocation and needs assessment
- **Government Officials:** Need official update dissemination capabilities
- **Affected Community Members:** Submit reports and access resource information

## Timeline & Milestones

### Sprint Schedule (8-10 hours total)

**Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (3-4 hours)**
- [ ] Supabase project setup with geospatial extensions
- [ ] Database schema creation with indexes
- [ ] Basic Express.js server with middleware
- [ ] Core CRUD APIs for disasters, reports, resources
- [ ] Gemini API integration for location extraction
- [ ] Basic geocoding pipeline

**Phase 2: Advanced Features (3-4 hours)**
- [ ] WebSocket implementation with Socket.IO
- [ ] Mock social media API with realistic data
- [ ] Supabase caching layer implementation
- [ ] Image verification endpoint
- [ ] Geospatial proximity queries
- [ ] Rate limiting and error handling

**Phase 3: Integration & Deployment (2-3 hours)**
- [ ] React frontend for API testing
- [ ] Web scraping for official updates
- [ ] Frontend-backend WebSocket integration
- [ ] Deployment to Vercel and Render
- [ ] Documentation and submission preparation

### Critical Path Dependencies
1. Supabase setup must complete before geospatial queries
2. Gemini API integration required before geocoding pipeline
3. Backend APIs must be functional before frontend development
4. WebSocket server implementation before client integration

## Resource Requirements

### Development Tools
- **AI Coding Assistant:** Cursor or Windsurf (primary development accelerator)
- **Code Repository:** GitHub for version control and submission
- **API Testing:** Postman or similar for endpoint validation

### External Services (Accounts Required)
- **Supabase:** Free tier PostgreSQL database with PostGIS
- **Google AI Studio:** Gemini API key for location extraction and image verification
- **Deployment Platforms:** Vercel (frontend) and Render (backend) free tiers

### Technical Dependencies
```json
{
  "backend": ["express", "socket.io", "@supabase/supabase-js", "cheerio", "cors", "helmet"],
  "frontend": ["react", "socket.io-client", "axios"],
  "development": ["nodemon", "concurrently", "dotenv"]
}
```

### Performance Considerations
- Implement geospatial indexes for sub-second query performance
- Use Supabase caching to minimize external API calls
- Structure logging for debugging and monitoring
- Implement graceful error handling for all external services

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **API Rate Limits:** Mitigated by Supabase caching with 1-hour TTL
- **Geospatial Query Performance:** Addressed by proper indexing strategy
- **External Service Failures:** Fallback to mock responses for social media and updates

### Timeline Risks
- **Feature Scope Creep:** Focus on core functionality first, bonus features last
- **Integration Complexity:** Use AI coding tools aggressively for rapid development
- **Deployment Issues:** Test deployment early in Phase 2
